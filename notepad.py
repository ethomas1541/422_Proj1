    TextBoxWithDefaultText
        Class used as a wrapper for the tkinter Text object. Used in very different ways either on the notepad screen
        or on the administrative server setup screen. This class is engineered to detect which screen it's on during
        instantiation and to change its behavior accordingly.

    server_setup(user)
        Essentially a wrapper for the config_handler module, which ensures that any server data entered is cached and
        can later be reconfigured by an admin user.

        On the program's first launch, the application has no knowledge of its sql server, so it is implied that the
        user should type in the necessary information.

        May serve as a launch point into select_user, or may require use of the back button, depending on how
        the function was called

    select_user()
        This function both validates the entered server configuration information, displaying a warning if it's not
        usable, making appropriate database queries if it is valid information, then populating the related UI with
        the results of those queries.

        Afterward, select_note is fired with the selected user as an argument.

    select_note(user)
        Opens a screen very similar to select_user(), except populated by a collection of the given user's note tables.

        Afterward, open_notepad is fired with several arguments collected from this function and select_user.

    open_notepad(user, note, connection, dicts)
        Arguments are defined at length in the related docstring

        Opens the notepad view, the main part of the program. If <note> refers to an existing note in the database,
        the entire structure of that note will be retrieved from the database, deserialized and placed in direct
        view of the user.

        Also contains a save button which manages serializing and sending data to the database.
